Research Article title: 

A Low-Cost Pupil Center Localization Algorithm based on Maximized Integral Voting of Circular Hollow Kernels


Citation: Ince, Ibrahim Furkan, Yusuf Sait Erdem, Faruk Bulut, and Md Haidar Sharif. "A low-cost pupil center localization algorithm based on maximized integral voting of circular hollow kernels." The Computer Journal 62, no. 7 (2019): 1001-1015.


Explanation

This article has been submitted to a scientific magazine for evaluation. The related documents are publicly available here. The implemented JAVA codes of the proposed eye tracking estimation model -in which there are frontal both eye area detection, pupil detection, and eye tracking estimation- can be publicly downloaded from here for examinations, studies and citations.

Dataset:
The whole and original test files including BioID Dataset, and the output files can be publicly downloadable from the authors. In each of these 1520 output file, there are 4 results: LX, LY, RX, and RY values. Their information is Left X, Left Y, Right X, Right Y coordinates respectively. All the dataset is downloadable here.

Processing:
By the way, do not forget the install Java PROCESSING onto your PC. All the codes have been executed in the Processing 2.2.1 environment, therefore Processing should be downloaded here.

Windows 32 bit:
