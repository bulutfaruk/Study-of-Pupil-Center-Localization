Pupil center localization is an essential requirement for robust eye gaze tracking systems. Stability on the pupil center location is 
the key metric for all gaze trackers since vibration on the pupil center location defects the accuracy of gaze on the eye tracking systems.
In this paper, a low-cost pupil center localization algorithm is presented. The aim is to propose a computationally inexpensive algorithm 
with high accuracy in terms of performance and processing speed. For this purpose, a computationally inexpensive pupil center localization 
algorithm based on maximized integral voting of candidate kernels is presented. As the kernel type, a novel Circular Hollow Kernel (CHK) 
is proposed. Estimation of pupil center is employed by applying a rule based schema for each pixel over the eye sockets. Additionally, 
several features of CHK are proposed for maximizing the probability of voting for each kernel. Experimental results show promising results
with 96.94% overall accuracy with around 13.89 milliseconds computational time (71.99 fps) for a single image as an average time by using
a standard personal computer. Additionally, an extensive benchmarking study indicates that proposed method obtains the best results among 
the methods without learning and almost the same results with other best methods with learning while processing speed is much higher and 
no learning is required. Furthermore, proposed system is fast enough to run on an average PC and also applicable to work with even a 
low-resolution webcam on real-time video stream.
